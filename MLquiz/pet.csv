Affenpinscher,"The Affen’s apish look has been described many ways. They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs.

In turn, owners tend to form a special bond with their eager workaholics. As one devotee puts it, Belgians “inspire such intense loyalty because they themselves live and love with such great passion.” The Belgian Sheepdog is a highly trainable herder whose versatility and intelligence is the stuff of canine legend.

Bulldog,"You can’t mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream “I’m a Bulldog!” The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won’t stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don’t mistake their easygoing ways for laziness—Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim.

Greyhound,"Greyhounds are the essence of the dog breeder’s credo “Form follows function.” From the narrow, aerodynamic skull to the shock-absorbing pads of the feet, Greyhounds are perfectly constructed for high-speed pursuit. The lean beauty of the Greyhound’s “inverted S” shape, created by the deep chest curving gently into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from which other coursing hounds have been struck.

The breed comes in several colors: white, red, black, brindle, sesame, and wolf grey. With early training, the Hokkaido is a very loyal and dedicated companion who wants to please his human family. They are incredibly intelligent thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families. The breed is extremely rare outside its native country. In Japan, there is an estimated population of around 10,000-12,000, and yearly registrations of between 900-1000. The Hokkaido is a dog of noteworthy endurance and dignity.

They combine the streamlined grace of a coursing hound and the instincts of a fearless Rat Terrier. These racy dogs come in two size varieties:  Toy (not exceeding 12 pounds) and Standard (not exceeding 22 pounds).",4,smart,25.4,30.48,5.44310844,5.44310844,15,17,0,toy group,0.4,weekly,0.4,occasional,0.6,regular exercise,0.8,easy training,0.6,responsive
Mastiff,"For the uninitiated, a face-to-face encounter with these black-masked giants can be startling. A male stands at least 30 inches at the shoulder and can outweigh many a full-grown man. The rectangular body is deep and thickly muscled, covered by a short double coat of fawn, apricot, or brindle stripes. The head is broad and massive, and a wrinkled forehead accentuates an alert, kindly expression. Mastiffs are patient, lovable companions and guardians who take best to gentle training. Eternally loyal Mastiffs are protective of family, and a natural wariness of strangers makes early training and socialization essential. Mastiffs are magnificent pets, but acquiring a powerful giant-breed dog is commitment not to be taken lightly. The colossal Mastiff belongs to a canine clan as ancient as civilization itself. A massive, heavy-boned dog of courage and prodigious strength, the Mastiff is docile and dignified but also a formidable protector of those they hold dear.",1,courageous,69.85,76.2,54.4310844,104.3262451,6,10,2,working group,0.2,occasional,0.4,occasional,0.6,regular exercise,0.6,agreeable,0.6,responsive

Miniature Bull Terrier,"In nearly every way the Mini is a Bull Terrier, only smaller. In fact, before 1991 the AKC classified the two Bullys as varieties of the same breed. Minis stand between 10 and 14 inches at the shoulder. They’re square, muscular, and, for their size, quite strong. Their trademark is a large egg-shaped head, with its dark, triangular eyes that twinkle with mischief. It’s impossible to mistake the Bull Terrier breeds for any other. The coat can be pure white, or white with predominate colored markings. In most every way the Miniature Bull Terrier is a Bull Terrier, only smaller.

Another charming aspect of the breed is that they tend to be quiet indoors or in their kennel, but do have a beautiful melodious baying call. They are not nuisance barkers. The Porcelaine is elegant, energetic, and a fierce hunter; he is used for small game, driving it to waiting guns. He is very fond of his owners, family, friends and children and he loves to take part in all family activities. He excels as a house pet and is easily crate trained and housebroken.",5,lively,55.88,58.42,24.94758035,28.12272694,12,13,3,miscellaneous class,0.2,occasional,0.2,infrequent,0.8,energetic,0.6,agreeable,0.6,responsive
Portuguese Podengo,"The Podengo is a rugged coursing hound that comes in two sizes: medio (medium, standing 16 to 22 inches at the shoulder) and grande (large, 22 to 28 inches). They also have two coat types: smooth and wirehaired. The breed’s enthusiasts describe it as “primitive,” that is, it’s a rustic, no-frills hound untouched by fads and fashion since arriving on the Iberian Peninsula ages ago. Among their distinctive characteristics are large, erect, triangular ears; a pyramid-shaped head that tapers to the nose; and sweetly expressive, almond-shaped eyes.Podengos, in general, are funny dogs that love to play. They easily entertain themselves with toys, chase each other and stalk each other around the house and yard. They are highly intelligent and learn new things very fast. Since they are a watchful dog though, they are not as easy going and playful with strangers and may view smaller animals like dogs and cats as prey. They may be quite reserved initially and prefer to greet strangers on their own terms. They are very tolerant and compliant, eager to please their family members and put up with most requests we make of them. Portuguese Podengos are lively, agile, playful, alert, highly intelligent but not always easy to train, independent yet loving with the family and sometimes suspicious of strangers. The breed's two sizes have different jobs: the larger hunts deer and boar and the medium-sized hunts rabbit. In the U.S, they are successful in coursing, agility, nose work, barn hunt, rally and in the conformation ring.",4,smart,40.64,71.12,15.87573295,29.93709642,10,12,3,miscellaneous class,0.4,weekly,0.8,regularly,0.8,energetic,0.6,agreeable,0.4,reserved with strangers

Deerhounds are, though, much larger and more substantial than Greyhounds—a good-size male can stand 32 inches at the shoulder and weigh 110 pounds. The crisp coat is seen in several colors; breed aficionados prefer the dark blue-gray coat. The tapered head and long neck add extra lift to an already stately hound. The crisply coated Scottish Deerhound, “Royal Dog of Scotland,” is a majestically large coursing hound struck from the ancient Greyhound template. Among the tallest of dog breeds, the Deerhound was bred to stalk the giant wild red deer.",3,gentle,71.12,81.28,34.01942775,49.8951607,8,11,1,hound group,0.2,occasional,0.6,seasonal,0.6,regular exercise,0.4,independent,0.6,responsive
Scottish Terrier,"The well-known Scottie silhouette is that of a short-legged but substantial terrier with distinctive furnishings at the beard, legs, and lower body. The wiry topcoat and soft, dense undercoat coat can be black, wheaten yellow, or a brindle-stripe pattern. Bright, piercing eyes, and erect ears and tail, convey keen alertness—a hallmark of Britain’s terrier breeds.The Scottie working style has been described as efficient and businesslike, and their aloofness toward strangers makes them excellent watchdogs. Their hunting instinct remains strong, which can complicate life for the neighbor’s cat, and Scotties are known to be cantankerous around other dogs. This bold and clever Scotsman enjoys brisk walks and upbeat play. A solidly compact dog of vivid personality, the Scottish Terrier is an independent, confident companion of high spirits. Scotties have a dignified, almost-human character. Their terrier persistence has earned the breed the nickname “the Diehard.”",1,courageous,25.4,25.4,8.16466266,9.97903214,12,12,6,terrier group,0.6,2-3 times a week,0.4,occasional,0.6,regular exercise,0.4,independent,0.6,responsive
